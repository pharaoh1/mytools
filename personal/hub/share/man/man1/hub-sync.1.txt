hub‐sync(1) ‐‐ Fetch git objects from upstream and update branch‐
es.  ===

## SYNOPSIS

‘hub sync‘


‐ If the local branch is outdated, fast‐forward it; ‐ If the  lo‐
cal branch contains unpushed work, warn about it; ‐ If the branch
seems merged and its upstream branch was deleted, delete it.

If a local branch doesn‘t have any  upstream  configuration,  but
has a same‐named branch on the remote, treat that as its upstream
branch.
